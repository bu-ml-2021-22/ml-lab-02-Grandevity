# Machine Learning Lab 2 - Data Analysis

## 6 - Exploratory Data Analysis

If you don't manage to complete this in the lab itself, please don't worry. I have added this with the assumption that most students would need to do this in their self-study time during the week.

### 6.1 - Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis is a significant part of machine learning (and your assignment).

Using the unit assessment dataset that you've already loaded, let's do some exploratory data analysis to answer some questions:

* How many instances are there in the dataset?
* Is the class balance equal?
* Which class is the MOST represented in the dataset?
* How many students passed?
* What is the mean mark (total), including non-submissions?
* What is the mean mark (total), excluding non-submissions?
* What is the mean level 4 mark for the students who passed?
* What is the mean level 4 mark for the students who failed?

### 6.2 - Data exploration tasks

Please follow the information and prompts in the jupyter notebook provided. For several questions, we have already covered things that'll give you the answer!

Have a play and see what else you may also learn from this dataset!
