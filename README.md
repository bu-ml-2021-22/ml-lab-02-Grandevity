# Machine Learning Lab 2

If you haven't done ML Lab 1, do that first as this lab assumes you've gotten to grips with (the basics of):

* Git / GitHub
* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks

For this week, we're covering:

* NumPy - arrays (datastructures)
* SciPy - scientific module/library
* Pandas - data processing & exploratory data analysis
* Matplotlib - visualisation (just exposing you to some basics this week)
* Linear regression


## Linear Algebra

First, let's start with a bit of practice with linear algebra to compound what we went through in the lecture.

You can find the linear algebra tasks [[here](linear-algebra.md)].


## NumPy & SciPy

Next, let's dig into some of the key libraries (modules) we'll be using in Python, ``NumPy`` and ``SciPy``.

You can find tasks for those libraries [[here](numpy-scipy.md)].


## Pandas & MatplotLib

Right, time to play around with some data, which we'll use ``Pandas`` for. We'll also touch on some visualisation this week via ``MatplotLib``, but more on that next week!

You can find tasks for Pandas [[here](pandas-matplotlib.md)].


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Ok, getting more serious now, putting together the things we've just gone through above. Let's jump into one of the key aspects of the unit (and your assignment) - exploratory data analysis.

If you're ready to jump in, you can find your tasks [[here](data-analysis.md)].


## [OPTIONAL] Analysis of Anscombe's Quartet

This is entirely optional, but if you're hungry/thirsty for some more data analysis
and perhaps like to see why descriptive statistics can be completely misleading,
this one is for you!

So, if you want, you can find a bonus task [[here](anscombes-quartet.md)].


## Study Progress

Please report your engagement with this lab (even if you do this at a later point in time)
