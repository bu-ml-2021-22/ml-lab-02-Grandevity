# Machine Learning Lab 2 - Anscombe's Quartet

This is entirely optional! Consider it a bonus task :star_struck:

## 7 - Analysis of Anscombe's data

There is a well-known data set in [anscombe-data.xlsx](data/anscombe-data.xlsx), which demonstrates an important point about statistics.

There are 4 data sets, one in each sheet/tab within the above spreadsheet. Your task is to use your pandas and matplotlib skills (gained above) to do the following for each data set:

1. Load the data into an appropriate data structure (feel free to copy paste data directly into Python code, or put into separate CSV files to be loaded, etc)

2. Calculate some basic summary statistics (refer to the descriptive stats from the Week 2 lecture)

3. Visualise the data with Matplotlib scatter plots

4. [BONUS] add a linear regression line to the scatter plot.

**PS**: There's already code for most of this in the jupyter notebook provided with this lab.

**QUESTION 3.1**: How do the summary statistics compare between the four data sets?

**QUESTION 3.2**: How do the scatter plots compare between the four data sets?


PS: all the above can be done with, e.g., ``numpy``, ``numpy.polynomial.polynomial`` and ``matplotlib.pyplot`` - so Pandas is not strictly needed for this task.
